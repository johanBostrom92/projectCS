Visualization:
Successfully integrated the code so we can read city data from a .CSV into our model. Then simulate the data and write to another .csv file which is then is plotted using python.
Further visual improvement and integration of automatically running python script from c++. 

Added so the system automatically  calculate weights depeding on distance to other cities and on population sizes.
Fixed Swap functionality that was previously broken.
