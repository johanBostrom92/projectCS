We had a meeting between the two teams to present and summarize on what the both teams have been doing. Discussing and taking questions about each other solutions.  
We have implemented vaccination funcitonality in the project, there is room for more customization but the system is working.
A rework of to our communitiy-system has been conducted, we can now feed the program with a list of communities and weights, which will be created and populated in the code. 
It is also now possible for each agent to travel inside its own community and to other communities influenced by their respective weights.
